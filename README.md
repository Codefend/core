`Codefend` is a versatile CLI tool designed to obfuscate not only your source code but also your folder and file names across any programming language or framework. In addition to its CLI functionality, Codefend is available as a plugin for Webpack, Rollup, and Vite.

Beyond basic obfuscation, Codefend offers advanced features. It seamlessly integrates with existing uglifiers or minifiers, providing a two-layer obfuscation process that creates a hidden code within another hidden code, ensuring irreversible protection of your source code.

To unleash Codefend's capabilities, it requires adherence to specific naming conventions within your project. Once set up, Codefend automates the obfuscation process, allowing you to focus on coding while it safeguards your intellectual property âœ¨

## Installation

#### `Globally`

```bash
npm install -g codefend
codefend -i  //required only the first time, generates .codefendrc.json
codefend -o  //obfuscates your whole project inside a new directory: 'codefend-output'
```

#### `Dev dependency`

```bash
npm install -D codefend
```

#### `npx`

In case you want to execute it directly without installing it on your machine:

```bash
npx codefend -i  //required only the first time, generates .codefendrc.json
npx codefend -o  //obfuscates your whole project inside a new directory: 'codefend-output'
```

#### `Webpack`

If you're using Webpack, you can use [webpack-plugin-codefend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-plugin-codefend) instead of directly using the CLI, keeping in mind that not all features are propagated to the plugin and may take time to become available.

#### `Rollup/Vite`

If you're using Rollup or Vite, you can use [rollup-plugin-codefend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-codefend) instead of directly using the CLI, keeping in mind that not all features are propagated to the plugin and may take time to become available.

## Commands

```shell
Usage: codefend [options]

Defend Your Code By All Means Necessary. ðŸ’ª ðŸ˜Ž

Options:
  -i, --init       Create the config file (.codefendrc.json)
  -o, --obfuscate  Obfuscate the project
  -c, --check      Check the config file for potential warnings/errors
  -v, --version    Output the version number
  -h, --help       Display help for command
```

## Basic Usage

### `Step 1`: Naming convention

`Add prefixes to the words that you want to encrypt.`

```js
//as a starting point:  prefix the words that should be encrypted with l_
class l_Calculator {
  l_sum(l_a, l_b) {
    const l_results = l_a + l_b;
    return l_results;
  }
}

//>>>>>>==== Will Become ======<<<<<<

class Ox0 {
  Ox1(Ox2, Ox3) {
    const Ox4 = Ox2 + Ox3;
    return Ox4;
  }
}

// Or for a better organized naming convention:
/** 
 * 
1- class -> starts with c_
2- function -> starts with f_
3- parameter -> starts with p_
4- local variable -> starts with l_
*/
class c_Calculator {
  f_sum(p_a, p_b) {
    const l_results = p_a + p_b;
    return l_results;
  }
}

//>>>>>>==== Same results ======<<<<<<
class Ox0 {
  Ox1(Ox2, Ox3) {
    const Ox4 = Ox2 + Ox3;
    return Ox4;
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- Html example, can work also with Angular,React,Vue,Svelte... in the same way -->

<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .l_red {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="l_red">l_secret</div>
    <div class="l_red">Hello World</div>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Will Become -->

<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .Ox1 {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="Ox1">Ox0</div>
    <div class="Ox1">Hello World</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### `Step 2`: Run the CLI

`navigate to the root of your project and run the following commands:`

```bash
codefend -i  //required only the first time, generates .codefendrc.json

```

```bash
codefend -o  //obfuscates your whole project inside a new directory: 'codefend-output'
```
